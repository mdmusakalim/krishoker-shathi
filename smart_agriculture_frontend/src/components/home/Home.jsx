                  It is farmer friendly: every picture used in the Smart Agriculture is taken from the field and the picture is used exactly as the farmer sees the problem in the field. As a result, the farmer can recognize the problem correctly. (Research has shown that the glitter and the pictures working in Photoshop confuse the farmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is environmentally friendly: it emphasizes environmentally friendly practices in pest management and includes Farmer Behavior Change Communication (FBCC); This will bring about some behavioral changes in the farmers which will reduce the recurrence of the same problem in the future and also reduce the use of chemical pesticides. At the same time, it provides specific advice that will reduce the use of random chemical pesticides.

                  The rationale for this initiative
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Using the Smart Agriculture will benefit both the service recipient and the service provider. The service recipient will get fast and accurate service and the service provider can easily and quickly solve any problem using the Smart Agriculture. By using the Smart Agriculture, the possible communication noise between the service recipient and the service provider can be brought down to the lowest level. The Smart Agriculture actually helps the farmer to properly present his problem to the extension worker. Using it, an advanced farmer can solve his crop problems on his own.
